4. Relevant Information:

   This is a rule-based model that qualitatively simulates moral reasoning.
   The model was intended to simulate how an ordinary person, down to about
   age five, reasons about harm-doing.

   The horn-clause theory and the 202 instances are the same as were used 
   in (Wogulis, 1994).  The top-level predicate to predict is guilty/1.
   For more information, e.g. on the generation of instances, see 
   (Wogulis, 1994).

5. Target Relation:

   - guilty(case)

   - Number of positive instances: 102

   - Negative instances correspond to the term: 

       - not(guilty(case)).

       - Number of negative instances: 100
